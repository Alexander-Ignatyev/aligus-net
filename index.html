<h2>Benvenuto</h2>

<p>Welcome to my site!</p>

<section>This site is a sort of landing page for my open-source projects.
  The list of them are available on <a href="/projects.html">projects page</a>.

<section>
  <p>The site has been written in <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> using <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a> library.</p>

  <p>Though I am not really good at front-end development I tried to use some cuttind-edge front-end technologies,
  including <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm language</a> for programming,
  <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS language</a> for style sheets
  and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp">Flexbox</a> for HTML layout.</p>
