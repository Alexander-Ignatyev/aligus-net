<em>Benvenuto nel mio sito!</em>

<section>This is a sort of landing page for my open-source projects.
  List of them is available on <a href="/projects.html">projects page</a>.
</section>

<section>
  <p>The site is a bunch of static pages hosted on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>,
    some of the pages call <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> functions.
    Therefore I can say it is an example of serverless architecture.
  </p>

  <p>Though I am not really good in front-end development I tried to use some cuttind-edge front-end technologies,
    including <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> for client-side programming (Haskell-like lanaguage which compiles to JavaScript),
    <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS language</a> for style sheets
    and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp">Flexbox</a> for HTML layout.
  </p>

  <p>Static pages generator has been written in <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>
    using <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a> library.
